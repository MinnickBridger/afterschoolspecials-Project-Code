Budgeting App Overview:
This app is a budgeting tool that can be used by anyone who wants to track his or her finances. Users will create an account and apply how much money they would like to spend each month (monthly income or budget). The user then adds categories that they spend their money on, for example a user might have utilities, food and groceries, savings, housing, emergency fund etc. After the user allocates their monthly budget for each of the categories the user can then start adding their daily expenses. For example if the user got groceries for $55.87, they can add that expense to their food and grocery category. The app keeps tracks of all the users expenses and tells the user how much money they have spent in each category, how much they have left to spend for each category. If the user goes over budget, the app will tell them and show how much over budget they are for that category. When the user wants to restart after the month is up, they can reset the budget and start again.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
